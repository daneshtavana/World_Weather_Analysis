# World_Weather_Analysis

# Objective

## In this Lesson we used API calls to get data from api.openweathermap.org and google maps. We randomly generated the lattitude and longitude coordinates to obtain the neartest city and hotel weather statistics.

# Python code and supporting data

## These python modules in the github directory were create during the lessons. Various plots and figures showing weather data and correlation  as a function of lattitude are available in the "data" folder.

## weatherPy.ipynb & VacationPy.ipnyb 

## The following python modules in the github directory are for parts 1, 2 and 3 of module 6 challenge. A "data" folder contains the  CSV files. The same "data" folder contains PNG image files.


## Weather_Database.ipynb, Vacation_Search.ipnyb,  Vacation_Itinerary.ipnyb


## cities.xls, WeatherPy_database.xls, WeatheryPy_vacation.xls


## WeatherPy_vacation_map.png, WeatherPy_travel_map.png, WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png

# Other key activities for this module included:

## Retrieved basic information with API call

## Used the try-except block to clean data

## Narrow Travel Searches Based on Temperature and Precipitation 

## Create a New Dataframe with Hotel Information Using Google API

## Create a pop-up marker with city and weather data and hotel name

## As time allows create a directions layer map to travel between cities

## Create a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary
